Narrowing the search space
--------------------------

By default Mist will compute the configured IT measure for all unique variable tuples, i.e. the complete tuple space. Tuples are constructed by sampling variables without replacement. The size of this search space is *N choose size*, which grows astronomically with the number of variables and the size of the tuples. The complete space for 5000 variables in 3-tuples is over 20 billion tuples! It is often necessary to take a slice of the complete space.

The algorithm::TupleSpace class allows you to define a subspace. First, you define two or more *Variable Groups*, which are simply named sets of variables. Usually these groups are disjoint and do not contain duplicates. In this context, Variable indices correspond to their column position in the input data.

::

    # Python syntax
    ts = mist.TupleSpace()
    ts.addVariableGroup("group1", [0,1,2,3])
    ts.addVariableGroup("group2", [4])


Next, specify one or more *Variable Group Tuples* to define the tuple space. The tuple space is generated by replacing the group names with variables sampled from the corresponding group.

::

    ts.addVariableGroupTuple(["group1", "group2"])
    # Will generate
    # 0,4
    # 1,4
    # 2,4
    # 3,4

Finally, load the TupleSpace object into the Mist object to set the tuple space.

::

    mist.set_tuple_space(ts)
    #...
    mist.compute()

Note that Variables are sampled without replacement, groups do not need to be contiguous, and groups can be listed multiple times in a tuple.

::

    ts.addVariableGroupTuple(["group1", "group1", "group2"])
    # Will generate
    # 0,1,4
    # 0,2,4
    # 0,3,4
    # 1,2,4
    # 1,3,4
    # 2,3,4

The tuples are generated on-the-fly by the TupleProducer thread, and so you do not need to keep the full tuple space in the working set (an option to set a pre-generated tuple space may be added in the future).
