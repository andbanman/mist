Mist
====

Mist is a Multivariable Information Theory-based relationship Search Tool. The Mist library API computes the shared information content of variables that may indicate a functional dependency. The type of IT measurement Mist uses is configurable, as are many search parameters.

Version 0.1.0

Mist for Python is available on PyPi: <https://pypi.org/project/libmist/>

Mist documentation is available on ReadTheDocs: <https://libmist.readthedocs.io>

Quick Start
-----------

The easiest way to run Mist is through the Python module. The following minimal example sets up a Mist object for a simple Symmetric Delta search (the default IT measurement).

::

    import libmist
    mist = libmist.Search()
    mist.load_file('/path/to/data.csv')
    mist.set_outfile('/dev/stdout')
    mist.start()

There are numerous functions to configure Mist -- below are some of the most important. For a full list read the API documentation for mist::Search.

::

    mist.load_ndarray()     # load data from a Python.Numpy.ndarray (see docs for restrictions)
    mist.set_tuple_size()   # set the number of variables in each tuple
    mist.set_measure()      # set the Information Theory Measure
    mist.set_threads()      # set the number of computration threads

This Python syntax is virtually identical to the C++ code you would write for a program using the Mist library, as you can see in the examples directory.

Building
--------

mist
~~~~

These packages are required to build the mist library:

- CMake (minimum version 3.5) <https://cmake.org/download/>
- Boost (minimum version 1.58.0) <https://www.boost.org/users/download/>.

Run *cmake* in out-of-tree build directory:

::

    mkdir /path/to/build
    cd /path/to/build
    cmake /path/to/mist
    make


mist python library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional requirements:

- Python development packages (python3-dev or python-dev).
- Boost Python and Numpy components. For Boost newer than 1.63 use the integrated Boost.Numpy (libboost-numpy) package. For earlier versions install ndarray/Boost.Numpy <https://github.com/ndarray/Boost.NumPy>.

Run *cmake* with *BuildPython* set to *ON*:

::

    mkdir /path/to/build
    cd /path/to/build
    cmake -DBuildPython:BOOL=ON /path/to/mist
    make

Note: both the mist and ndarray/Boost.numpy builds use the default python version installed on the system. To use a different python version, change the FindPythonInterp, FindPythonLibs, and FindNumpy invocations in both packages to use the same python version.

Documentation (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional Requirements

- Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html>
- Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>
- Breathe <https://pypi.org/project/breathe/>
- sphinx_rtd_theme <https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme>


Run *cmake* with *BuildDoc* set to *ON*:

::

    mkdir /path/to/build
    cd /path/to/build
    cmake -DBuildDoc:BOOL=ON /path/to/mist
    make Sphinx

And then run the build as above.

For Developers
--------------

This project follows the Pitchfork Layout (PFL).  Namespaces are encapsulated in separate directories. Any physical unit must only include headers within its namespace, the root namespace (core), or interface headers in other namespaces.  The build system discourages violations by making it difficult to link objects across namespaces.

Documentation for this project is dynamically generated with Doxygen and Sphinx. Comments in the source following Javadoc style are included in the docs. Non-documented comments, e.g. implementation notes, developer advice, etc. follow standard C++ comment style. This README and other documents should be written in the intersection of Markdown and reStructuredText <https://gist.github.com/dupuy/1855764> for best interoperability.
